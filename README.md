### Summary

The statistical analysis for temperature averages and ranges for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii, indicate the temperatures to be in the ideal range (70-80° F) with little variability (standard deviation below 4°), which is ideal for tourism and appear to be healthy indicators for opening a surf shop business.
